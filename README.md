### Approach to Problem

To find the reason for customer churn, primarily we have to understand our customer. Firm needs to upfront 'why?'. We have to ask lot of quries to ourself. If we try to answer our own "why?"s, its drives us to our penultimate goal.

After explored the past customer behaviorals, we breaks to two subsets,
### Happy customers:

If customer feels happy. Look over the key features that satisfies our customer need. This gives overall understanding of our product.
Unhappy customer
### Unhappy Customers:
Survey over unhappy customers, People who are unhappy might be more honest about our products, which fails to meet their needs.
